# SkinCancerMNIST_CNN
CNN model implementation

The dataset Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 features over 10,000 publicly available images of skin lesions. Using a convolution neural network with Keras TensorFlow in backend, this paper attempts to detect seven different classes of skin cancer using the dataset and interprets the results to determine the worth of the model in a practical scenario.
